# flatworm: Flattened detrended QQ plots

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mjskay/flatworm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mjskay/flatworm)

_Matthew Kay, University of Michigan <mjskay@umich.edu>_

This project is a fork from [tidybayes](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes) 
that includes only the code for flatworm plots, which I felt was both secondary
enough to that package (and applicable enough to other things) to deserve
a separate package. Still a work in progress.

## Installation

You can install the latest development version from GitHub with these R
commands:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjskay/flatworm")
```

## Examples

TBD.

## Problems

Should you encounter any issues with this package, contact Matthew Kay
(<mjskay@umich.edu>). If you have found a bug, please file it [here]
(https://github.com/mjskay/flatworm/issues/new) with minimal code to reproduce
the issue.
